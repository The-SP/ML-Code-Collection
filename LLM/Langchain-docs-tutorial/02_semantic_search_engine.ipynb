NIKE is\\nthe largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations, which are comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores\\nand sales through our digital platforms (also referred to as \"NIKE Brand Digital\"), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales\\nrepresentatives in nearly all countries around the world. We also offer interactive consumer services and experiences through our digital platforms. Nearly all of our\\nproducts are manufactured by independent contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel products are manufactured outside the United States, while equipment products\\nare manufactured both in the United States and abroad.\\nAll references to fiscal 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are to NIKE, Inc.\\'s fiscal years ended May 31, 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Any references to other fiscal\\nyears refer to a fiscal year ending on May 31 of that year.\\nPRODUCTS\\nOur NIKE Brand product offerings are aligned around our consumer construct focused on Men\\'s, Women\\'s and Kids\\'. We also design products specifically for the Jordan\\nBrand and Converse. We believe this approach allows us to create products that better meet individual consumer needs while accelerating our largest growth\\nopportunities.\\nNIKE\\'s athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We\\nplace considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products. Our Men\\'s, Women\\'s and Jordan Brand\\nfootwear products currently lead in footwear sales and we expect them to continue to do so.\\nWe also sell sports apparel, which features the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear.\\nOur sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athletic use, although many of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes,\\nand demonstrates our commitment to innovation and high-quality construction. Our Men\\'s and Women\\'s apparel products currently lead in apparel sales and we expect\\nthem to continue to do so. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in \"collections\" of similar use or by category. We also market apparel with licensed college\\nand professional team and league logos.\\nWe sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats,\\ngloves, protective equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through\\nour wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc., doing business as Air Manufacturing Innovation.\\nOur Jordan Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused on basketball performance and culture\\nusing the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results for Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments.\\nOur wholly-owned subsidiary brand, Converse, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses casual sneakers, apparel and accessories\\nunder the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone\\nbasis.\\nIn addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our NIKE Direct operations, we have also entered into license\\nagreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using NIKE-owned trademarks, certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment\\ndesigned for sports activities.\\n2023 FORM 10-K 1'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './nke-10k-2023.pdf', 'page': 4, 'page_label': '5'}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nWe also offer interactive consumer services and experiences as well as digital products through our digital platforms, including fitness and activity apps; sport, fitness and\\nwellness content; and digital services and features in retail stores that enhance the consumer experience.\\nSALES AND MARKETING\\nWe experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those\\nin the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular\\ntypes of footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as other macroeconomic, strategic, operating and logistics-related factors.\\nBecause NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity and availability of various sports and fitness activities, as well as changing design trends, affect\\nthe demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new\\nproducts, styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could\\nhave a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.\\nOUR MARKETS\\nWe report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the\\ndesign, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company\\'s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North\\nAmerica; Europe, Middle East & Africa (\"EMEA\"); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (\"APLA\"), and include results for the NIKE and Jordan brands. Sales\\nthrough our NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment.\\nConverse is also a reportable operating segment and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and\\naccessories. Converse direct to consumer operations, including digital commerce, are reported within the Converse operating segment results.\\nUNITED STATES MARKET\\nFor fiscal 2023, NIKE Brand and Converse sales in the United States accounted for approximately 43% of total revenues, compared to 40% and 39% for fiscal 2022 and\\nfiscal 2021, respectively. We sell our products to thousands of retail accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic\\nspecialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts. In the United States, we utilize NIKE sales offices to solicit such sales. During\\nfiscal 2023, our three largest United States customers accounted for approximately 22% of sales in the United States.\\nOur NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer operations sell our products to consumers through various digital platforms. In addition, our NIKE Direct and Converse\\ndirect to consumer operations sell products through the following number of retail stores in the United States:\\nU.S. RETAIL STORES NUMBER\\nNIKE Brand factory stores 213 \\nNIKE Brand in-line stores (including employee-only stores) 74 \\nConverse stores (including factory stores) 82 \\nTOTAL 369 \\nIn the United States, NIKE has eight significant distribution centers.
